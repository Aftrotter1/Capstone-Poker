# Capstone Poker Project

## Project Goals

The goal of our project was given to us by Doctor Herzog. She wants an online poker game repository that her students in her Machine Learning class can use to test the poker stratagems they design. As such, our project seeks to implement the following:
- Create a repository that hosts a poker game that can be populated with a variety of different bots.
- Allow Students to upload their own coded bots to test against the hosted bots.
- Create and maintain a leaderboard to show overall bot effectiveness.
